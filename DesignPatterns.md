# Design Patterns

A design pattern is a description or template defined by software industry experts as solution to some of the common problems faced in the world of software design. As a software architect one may face problems designing a software which have already been faced by many others in the industry. In order to make it easier to solve such problems, design patterns have been defined. Design patterns do not provide an exact solution but just a template or a set of guidelines that can be followed in order to make the software expansible, robust, secure and easy to use. One may need to modify a design pattern or use multiple patterns in coordination to solve one's problem.

## Uses of Design Patterns

Design patterns can help you speed up development process by preventing 're-inventing the wheel' and use already proven design paradigms. Using design patterns enables you to avoid problems that are not visible now but may appear at later stages. Reusing design patterns improves code readibility and enables architects communication among architects using well understood names for software interactions.

### Creational design patterns
These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

1. **Abstract Factory** - 
Creates an instance of several families of classes
2. **Builder** -
Separates object construction from its representation
3. **Factory Method** -
Creates an instance of several derived classes
4. **Object Pool** -
Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
5. **Prototype** -
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
6. **Singleton** -
A class of which only a single instance can exist

### Structural design patterns
These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

 
1. **Adapter** -
Match interfaces of different classes
2. **Bridge** -
Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
3. **Composite** -
A tree structure of simple and composite objects
4. **Decorator** -
Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
5. **Facade** -
A single class that represents an entire subsystem
6. **Flyweight** -
A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
7. **Private Class Data** -
Restricts accessor/mutator access
8. **Proxy** -
An object representing another object

### Behavioral design patterns
These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.

1. **Chain of responsibility** -
A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
2. **Command** -
Encapsulate a command request as an object
3. **Interpreter** -
A way to include language elements in a program
4. **Iterator** -
Sequentially access the elements of a collection
5. **Mediator** -
Defines simplified communication between classes
6. **Memento** -
Capture and restore an object's internal state
7. **Null Object** -
Designed to act as a default value of an object
8. **Observer** -
A way of notifying change to a number of classes
9. **State** -
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
10. **Strategy** -
Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
11. **Template method** -
Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
12. **Visitor** -
Defines a new operation to a class without change
